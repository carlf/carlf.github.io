As much as I love markdown, I would much rather put my muscle memory to use keeping my content in org-mode files. This thinking took me to the excellent org-mode extension ox-hugo. This module allows you to keep your content in a monolithic org file and simply exports neatly to the markdown that hugo expects.</description></item></channel></rss>
